                <em>This in an authentic recipe for mojito (insert doubt meme).
                    I sized the recipe for one serving, but you can adjust it accordingly and
                    make a pitcher full. It's very refreshing drink for hot summer day (in my country they are very hot).
                    But careful when drinking it, however. If you make a pitcher you might be tempted to drink the whole
                    thing yourself (I'll do it anyway), and you just might find yourself talking Spanish in no time! (I don't care, Spanish is my native language).
